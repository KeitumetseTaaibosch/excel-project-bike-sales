### Project Objective
This project's goal is to determine the main factors driving bike purchases by analysing consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.  We seek to offer practical insights that can assist data-driven marketing and sales initiatives by identifying trends in customer data.

### Dataset Overview
##### Data Source: 
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the    "bike_sales_data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each bike sale made by the company.
##### Total Records:
1,000 unique entries (after data cleaning)
##### Key Data Points:
- Demographics: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Region
- Financial Data: Income, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars Owned
- Behavioural Data: Commute Distance, Children, Purchased Bike

### Tools
- Excel- Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables and Visualization

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed 26 duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- The dataset was fully populated after missing values were checked.
- Standardized column formats to ensure consistency.

### Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables
##### To gain insights from the dataset, several Pivot Tables were created in Excel:
- Bike Purchases by Age Group: Analyzed which age group had the highest bike purchase rate.
- Income vs. Bike Purchases: Used pivot tables to assess trends in purchasing behavior based on income brackets.
- Commute Distance & Bike Ownership: Examined whether shorter commutes correlated with higher bike purchases.
- Regional Purchase Trends: Mapped bike purchase distribution across different regions.
These pivot tables helped formulate suggestions for business strategy and offered important insights into consumer behaviour.

### Key Analysis & Findings
##### Bike purchase distribution
- Majority of bike buyers belong to the middle age group 31-54 years.
##### Income & Bike Purchase
- Customers with an income range of R56000 - R60000 are the most likely to purchase a bike.
- Higher-income individuals show higher purchase rates compared to lower-income groups.
##### Commute Distance vs. Bike Ownership
- Individuals with shorter commute distances (0-2 miles) are more likely to own a bike.
##### Occupation & Bike Purchases
- Professionals show the highest likelihood of purchasing a bike.
##### Regional Trends
- North America has the highest bike purchase rate.
- The Pacific has the lowest purchase rate.

### Recommendations
##### Based on the analysis done, we recommend the following actions:
- In terms of target audience and marketing, they need to focus on the middle age group as they are most likely to purchase a bike.
- They need to promote bikes in North America and offer incentives in the Pacific and Europe as they are low-purchase regions.
- They need to adjust pricing and financing options for individuals with income bracket between R50 000 - R56 000 to encourage purchases.
- They need to market bikes as an alternative for short-distance commmutes to increase adoption

### Conclusion
The key factors influencing bike purchases are highlighted in this analysis, along with practical suggestions for focused marketing and sales tactics. This company can improve their product offerings and gain a deeper understanding of their customers by utilizing data-driven decision-making.
