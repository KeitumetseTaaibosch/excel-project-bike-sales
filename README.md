### Project Objective
This project's goal is to determine the main factors driving bike purchases by analysing consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.  We seek to offer practical insights that can assist data-driven marketing and sales initiatives by identifying trends in customer data.

### Dataset Overview
##### Data Source: 
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the    "bike_sales_data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each bike sale made by the company.
##### Total Records:
1,000 unique entries (after data cleaning)
##### Key Data Points:
- Demographics: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Region
- Financial Data: Income, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars Owned
- Behavioural Data: Commute Distance, Children, Purchased Bike

### Tools
- Excel- Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables and Visualization

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed 26 duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- The dataset was fully populated after missing values were checked.
- Standardized column formats to ensure consistency.

### Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables
##### To gain insights from the dataset, several Pivot Tables were created in Excel:
- Bike Purchases by Age Group: Analyzed which age group had the highest bike purchase rate.
- Income vs. Bike Purchases: Used pivot tables to assess trends in purchasing behavior based on income brackets.
- Commute Distance & Bike Ownership: Examined whether shorter commutes correlated with higher bike purchases.
- Regional Purchase Trends: Mapped bike purchase distribution across different regions.
These pivot tables helped formulate suggestions for business strategy and offered important insights into consumer behaviour.
