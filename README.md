This project's goal is to determine the main factors driving bike purchases by analysing consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.  We seek to offer practical insights that can assist data-driven marketing and sales initiatives by identifying trends in customer data.

### Dataset Overview
##### Data Source: 
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the    "bike_sales_data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each bike sale made by the company.
##### Total Records:
1,000 unique entries (after data cleaning)
##### Key Data Points:
- Demographics: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Region
- Financial Data: Income, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars Owned
- Behavioural Data: Commute Distance, Children, Purchased Bike

### Tools
- Excel- Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables and Visualization

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed 26 duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- The dataset was fully populated after missing values were checked.
- Standardized column formats to ensure consistency.

### Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables
##### To gain insights from the dataset, several Pivot Tables were created in Excel:
- Bike Purchases by Age Group: Analyzed which age group had the highest bike purchase rate.
- Income vs. Bike Purchases: Used pivot tables to assess trends in purchasing behavior based on income brackets.
- Commute Distance & Bike Ownership: Examined whether shorter commutes correlated with higher bike purchases.
- Regional Purchase Trends: Mapped bike purchase distribution across different regions.
These pivot tables helped formulate suggestions for business strategy and offered important insights into consumer behaviour.
